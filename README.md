# TikTok Commerce

We imagined a future where E-Commerce meets Social Media, and Tiktok would be the perfect platform by having both TikTok Shop and TikTok Live, a streamingÂ platform that has many Tiktokers streaming content live to millions of people every day and a virtual marketplace all on the same platform.  Tiktok Commerce is a web application for both Suppliers and TikTokers to manage their dropshipping platform.
